# Piperacillin-Dose-Exposure-Modelling-Using-Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates dose–exposure modelling at steady state using linear regression
to evaluate the relationship between Piperacillin infusion rate and steady-state
piperacillin plasma concentration (Css).

## Data Source
Publicly available teaching dataset, imported
directly from a GitHub repository to ensure reproducibility.

## Objectives
- Visualise the relationship between infusion rate and steady-state concentration
- Assess the correlation between dose rate and exposure
- Fit and interpret a linear regression model
- Estimate mean clearance at steady state
- Predict infusion rates required to achieve a target Css of 16 mg/L
- Identify a conservative infusion rate ensuring ≥90% probability of target attainment

## Methods
- Exploratory data visualisation 
- Linear regression modelling
- Pearson correlation analysis
- Prediction intervals for target attainment assessment 
- Reproducible analysis using R and R Markdown

## Tools
- R (tidyverse)
- GitHub for version control

## Relevance
This workflow reflects dose–exposure and target-attainment analyses commonly performed in
clinical pharmacology, pharmacometrics, and pharmaceutical/CRO data environments.

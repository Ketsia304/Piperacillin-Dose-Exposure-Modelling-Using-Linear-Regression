# Piperacillin-Dose-Exposure-Modelling-Using-Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates dose–exposure modelling using linear regression
to evaluate the relationship between infusion rate and steady-state
piperacillin concentration.

## Objectives
- Visualise infusion rate vs steady-state concentration
- Assess correlation between dose rate and exposure
- Fit and interpret a linear regression model
- Estimate mean clearance at steady state
- Predict infusion rates achieving a target Css of 16 mg/L
- Identify a conservative dose ensuring 90% target attainment

## Methods
- Linear regression
- Pearson correlation
- Prediction intervals for target attainment
- Reproducible analysis using R and R Markdown

## Tools
- R (tidyverse)
- GitHub for version control

## Relevance
This workflow reflects dose–exposure analyses commonly performed in
clinical pharmacology, pharmacometrics, and pharma/CRO data environments.
